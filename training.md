# Access the interpreter

```python
$ python3.6
Python 3.6 (default, Sep 16 2015, 09:25:04)
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```
---

# Numbers

```python
>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> 50 - 5*6
20
>>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
5.0
>>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
1.6	
>>> 17 // 3  # floor division discards the fractional part
5
>>> 17 % 3  # the % operator returns the remainder of the division
2
>>> 5 ** 2  # 5 squared
25
```

???
We can use Python to make regular math operations

The order of operations is the same as usual

Pay attention to the difference between the normal division `/` and the floor division `//`

`%` is the modulo operation, returning the remainder of the division

`**` can be use to return the power of a number
--

## Create variables
```python
>>> width = 20
>>> height = 5 * 9
>>> width * height
>>> n  # try to access an undefined variable
```

???
Create a variable is as simple as defining it by choosing a name for it and assign it a value with `=`
If we try to access a variable that doesn't exist, we get an exception
---

# Numbers

## _ Variable

```python
>>> tax = 12.5 / 100
>>> price = 100.50
>>> price * tax
>>> price + _
>>> round(_, 2)
```

???
The `_` variable can be used, in the interpreter, to get the value of the last printed expression

---

# Numbers

## Exercises

* What is the result of `\[(10 + 2.5) * 3\]`
* What is the result of `\[(50 * 10)^{1/2}\]`
* How could we verify that a number is even?

???
We just need to use the basic python arithmetic operators to have the results.

To test if a number is even, we can test number % 2 == 0

---

# Strings

```python
>>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes
>>> 'doesn\'t'  # use \' to escape the single quote...
>>> "doesn't"  # ...or use double quotes instead
>>> '"Yes," he said.'
>>> "\"Yes,\" he said."
>>> '"Isn\'t," she said.'
```

???
This is just to demonstrate the different ways to create strings and to escape some elements

--

```python
>>> s = 'First line.\nSecond line.'  # \n means newline
>>> s  # without print(), \n is included in the output
>>> print(s)  # with print(), \n produces a new line
```

???
Show the difference between the output on the interpreter and the built-in print() function

---

# Strings

```python
>>> print('C:\some\name')  # here \n means newline!
>>> print(r'C:\some\name')  # note the r before the quote
```

???
We can also create raw strings with r""

--

```python
print("""\
Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]
        -h                        Display this usage message
        -H hostname               Hostname to connect to
""")
```

???
Multi-line strings can be obtained with triple simple (double) quotes.

They are also used to document

--

```python
>>> 3 * 'un' + 'ium'
```

???
We can apply multiplication and addition of strings.

---

# Strings

```python
>>> text = ('Put several strings within parentheses '
...         'to have them joined together.')
>>> text
>>> prefix = 'Py'
>>> prefix 'thon'  # can't concatenate a variable and a string literal
>>> ('un' * 3) 'ium'
```

???
Two string litterals can be joined togheter if we use parentheses

We can't concatenate a string litteral with a variable (use +)

We can't concatenate a string litteral and an expression (use +)

--

```python
>>> word = 'Python'
>>> word[0]  # character in position 0
>>> word[-1]  # last character
>>> word[0:2]  # characters from position 0 (included) to 2 (excluded)
>>> word[42]  # the word only has 6 characters
>>> word[4:42]
>>> word[0] = 'J'
>>> s = 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'
>>> len(s)
```

???
Strings are indiced

We can create slices [from:to not included]

The complete form of slices is [from:to:step]

We get an error if we use an indice that is out of range

No error for the slices ;)

Strings are immutable!

---

# Strings

## Exercises

* How can we know if `'Python'` is contained **in** `'Python is great'`?
* Show a string slice that represents the whole string
* What slice parameters do we need to use?
```python
>>> a = 'I will never'
>>> b = 'learn Python'
>>> c = a[?] + b[?]
>>> c == 'I will learn Python'
>>> True
```

???

- 'Python' in 'Python is great'
- [:]
- a[:6] + b[:]

---

# Strings

## Exercises

* How can we know if a string contains only alpha-numeric characters?
* What does the following code prints?
```python
>>> a = 'Today we have {0} hours of course left together'.format(2)
>>> print(a)
```

For more information, see:

[String methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#textseq)

[Format Strings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings)

???
- 'test'.isalnum()
- Just try...

---

# Lists

```python
>>> squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 20]
>>> squares[0]  # indexing returns the item
>>> squares[-1]
>>> squares[:]
>>> squares + [ 36, 49 ]
>>> squares[5] = 25
>>> squares.append(8**2)
>>> squares[3:] = []
>>> squares[:] = []
```

???
Lists are an ensemble of indiced values.

They can be of different types.

We can also get slices

They are mutable

To append: list.append()

To insert: list.insert(ind, elt)

--

```python
>>> a = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> n = [1, 2, 3]
>>> x = [a, n]
>>> x[0]
>>> x[0][1]
```

???
We can nest lists together

It is possible then to have multi-dimensional lists/arrays (even if those are not arrays) 

--

```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> for elt in a:
...	print(elt)
```

???
We can simply loop over all elements with for ... in

Behind the scenes, it will use the list and generate iterators

---

# Lists

## Exercises

* Given the following list:
```python
>>> a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] 
```
Add 1 to all the items and print them
* Using the same list, print the sum of all the elements
* Using the same list, print the multiplication of all the elements

???
- for elt in a: print(a + 1)
- tot = 0

for elt in a: tot += elt

- tot *= elt

---

# Control Flow

## if Statements

```python
>>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
>>> if x < 0:
...     x = 0
...     print('Negative changed to zero')
... elif x == 0:
...     print('Zero')
... elif x == 1:
...     print('Single')
... else:
...     print('More')
```

???
We can make conditions with if .. elif (else if) and else.

If the first condition is not match, we pass to the second, until we reach the last, default one (else)

The comparison operators are == != > < >= <=

---

# Control Flow

## for Statement

```python
words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
>>> for w in words:
...     print(w, len(w))
>>> for w in words[:]:  # Loop over a slice copy of the entire list.
...     if len(w) > 6:
...         words.insert(0, w)
```

???
Remark the difference between looping on the list or on a copy (slice)

---

# Control Flow

## while Statement

```python
>>> i = 0
>>> while i <= 10:
... 	print(i)
```
???
We will face an error here...

For while, we have to specify a condition. It could also be used to iterate on lists with the indices

--

```python
>>> i = 0
>>> while i <= 10:
... 	print(i)
... 	i += 1
```

---

# Control Flow

## range Function

```python
>>> for i in range(5):
...     print(i)
>>> range(5, 10)
>>> range(1, 10, 3)
>>> a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb']
>>> for i in range(len(a)):
...     print(i, a[i])
```

???
Range will give a range of elements from 0 to the last elt not included

Another option to loop on lists with the indices

---

# Control Flow

## break and continue Statements, and else Clauses on Loops

```python
>>> for num in range(2, 10):
...     if num % 2 == 0:
...         print("Found an even number", num)
...         continue
...     print("Found a number", num)

>>> for n in range(2, 10):
...     for x in range(2, n):
...         if n % x == 0:
...             print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)
...             break
...     else:
...         # loop fell through without finding a factor
...         print(n, 'is a prime number')
```

???
Break will stop the loop that it is within (in this case, the inner loop)

Continue will go to the next iteration

---

# Control Flow

# pass Statements

```python
>>> while True:
...     pass
```

???
Pass does nothing ... at all

It can be used to create short classes or to not implement yet some functions.

raise NotImplementedError is a way better solution

Ignoring errors... No!

Create classes that are inheriting but do not add new functions/attributes

---

# Control Flow

## Exercises

* Write code that prints all the odd numbers in a list
* Write code that removes all the duplicates in a list 
* Write code that prints the greatest number in a list
* Write code that sort the numbers in a list

# Intermezzo

## Zen of Python

Beautifull is better than ugly.

Explicit is better than implicit.

Simple is better than complex.

Complex is better than complicated.

Flat is better than nested.

Sparse is better than dense.

Readability counts.

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

Although practicality beats purity.

Errors should never pass silently.

---

# Intermezzo

## Zen of Python


Unless explicitly silenced.

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

Now is better than never.

Although never is often better than *right* now.

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

# Errors and Exceptions

## Defining Clean-up Actions

```python
def print_file(filename):
    try:
        f = open(filename)
        s = f.read()
    except OSError as err:
        print("OS error: {}".format(err))
    else:
        print(s)
        f.close()
    finally:
        print("Tried to open {}".format(filename))
```

# Classes

## Why?

```python
point = (0, 0)
def add(a, b):
    c = (a[0] + b[0], a[1] + b[1])
    return c
print(point)
```

Problems:

* A new `point` involves using a `tuple`
* To access `x` and `y` coordinates is not obvious. Is it p[0] or p[1]?
* What is the representation of `point`?
* ... 

How can we improve our `point`?

# Classes

## First try on Point

```python
class Point():

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
```

```python
p = Point(0, 0)
p.x = 1
p.y = 2
print(p)
```

## How to represent Point?

```python
class Point():
    def __repr__(self):
        return "Point(x: {}, y: {})".format(self.x, self.y)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return "({}, {})".format(self.x, self.y)
```

```python
p = Point(0, 1)
p
print(p)
```

## How to add `Point`s?

```python
class Point():
    def add(self, other):
        x = self.x + other.x
        y = self.y + other.y
        return Point(x, y)
```

```python
class Point():
    def __add__(self, other):
        x = self.x + other.x
        y = self.y + other.y
        return Point(x, y)
```

```python
p1 = Point(1, 2)
p2 = Point(1, 1)
p3 = p1 + p2
```

## Create a `Circle`

```python
circle = (Point(1, 1), 1)
```

```python
class Circle(Point):
    def __init__(self, x, y, r):
        super().__init__(x, y)
        self.r = r
```

```python
c = Circle(1, 1, 1)
```

## Create a `Line`

```python
class Line():
    def __init__(self, *points):
        self.points = list(points)
```
